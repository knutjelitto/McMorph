[Title]     GNU C Library

[Description]
The GNU C Library is the standard C library of the GNU system. It defines the system calls and
other basic functionality necessary to write programs in the C language. It handles low-level
functionality that communicates with the kernel, such as process and file management, as well as
higher-level functionality such as string manipulation or command-line argument handling.
