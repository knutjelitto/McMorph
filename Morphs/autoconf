[Title]     Autoconf

[Description]
Autoconf offers the developer a robust set of M4 macros which expand into shell code to test the
features of Unix-like systems and to adapt automatically their software package to these systems.
The resulting shell scripts are self-contained and portable, freeing the user from needing to know
anything about Autoconf or M4.
