[Title]     BusyBox (static,musl)

[Description]
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It
provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc.
The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins;
however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like
their GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded
system.
