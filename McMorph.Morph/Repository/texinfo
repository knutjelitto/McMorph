[Title]     GNU Texinfo

[Description]
Texinfo is the official documentation format of the GNU project. It uses a single source file using
explicit commands to produce a final document in any of several supported output formats, such as
HTML or PDF. This package includes both the tools necessary to produce Info documents from their
source and the command-line Info reader. The emphasis of the language is on expressing the content
semantically, avoiding physical markup commands.
