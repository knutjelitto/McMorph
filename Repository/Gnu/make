[Title]     GNU Make

[Description]
Make is a program that is used to control the production of executables or other files from their
source files. The process is controlled from a Makefile, in which the developer specifies how each
file is generated from its source. It has powerful dependency resolution and the ability to
determine when files have to be regenerated after their sources change. GNU make offers many
powerful extensions over the standard utility.
