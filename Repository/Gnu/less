[Title]     GNU Less

[Description]
GNU less is a pager, a program that allows you to view large amounts of text in page-sized chunks.
Unlike traditional pagers, it allows both backwards and forwards movement through the document. It
also does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so it starts faster than most
text editors.
