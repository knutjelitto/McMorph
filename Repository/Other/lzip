[Title]     LZip

[Description]
Lzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with very safe integrity checking
and a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip
and compresses better than bzip2, which makes it well suited for software distribution and data
archiving.
