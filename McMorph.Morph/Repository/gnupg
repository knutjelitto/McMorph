[Title]     GNU GnuPG

[Description]
The GNU Privacy Guard is a complete implementation of the OpenPGP standard. It is used to encrypt
and sign data and communication. It features powerful key management and the ability to access
public key servers. It includes several libraries: libassuan (IPC between GnuPG components),
libgpg-error (centralized GnuPG error values), and libskba (working with X.509 certificates and CMS
data).
