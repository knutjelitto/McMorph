[Title]     GNU Screen

[Description]
GNU Screen is a terminal window manager that multiplexes a single terminal between several
processes. The virtual terminals each provide features such as a scroll-back buffer and a
copy-and-paste mechanism. Screen then manages the different virtual terminals, allowing you to
easily switch between them, to detach them from the current session, or even splitting the view to
show two terminals at once.
