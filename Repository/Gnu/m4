[Title]     GNU M4

[Description]
GNU M4 is an implementation of the M4 macro language, which features some extensions over other
implementations, some of which are required by GNU Autoconf. It is used as a macro processor, which
means it processes text, expanding macros as it encounters them. It also has some built-in
functions, for example to run shell commands or to do arithmetic.
