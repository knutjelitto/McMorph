[Title]     GNU GMP

[Description]
GMP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed integers, rational numbers
and floating point numbers. The precision is only limited by the available memory. The library is
highly optimized, with a design focus on execution speed. It is aimed at use in, for example,
cryptography and computational algebra.
