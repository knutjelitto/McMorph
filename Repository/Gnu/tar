[Description]
Tar provides the ability to create tar archives, as well as the ability to extract, update or list
files in an existing archive. It is useful for combining many files into one larger file, while
maintaining directory structure and file information such as permissions and creation/modification
dates. GNU tar offers many extensions over the standard utility.
