[Title] The GNU Bourne-Again SHell

[Description]
Bash is the shell, or command-line interpreter, of the GNU system. It is compatible with the Bourne
Shell, but it also integrates useful features from the Korn Shell and the C Shell and new
improvements of its own. It allows command-line editing, unlimited command history, shell functions
and aliases, and job control while still allowing most sh scripts to be run without modification.
