[Title]     GNU Findutils

[Description]
Findutils supplies the basic file directory searching utilities of the GNU system. It consists of
two primary searching utilities: find recursively searches for files in a directory according to
given criteria and locate lists files in a database that match a query. Two auxiliary tools are
included: updatedb updates the file name database and xargs may be used to apply commands with
arbitrarily long arguments.
