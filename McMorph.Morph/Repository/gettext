[Title]     GNU Gettext

[Description]
GNU Gettext is a package providing a framework for translating the textual output of programs into
multiple languages. It provides translators with the means to create message catalogs, as well as
an Emacs mode to work with them, and a runtime library to load translated messages from the
catalogs. Nearly all GNU packages use Gettext.
