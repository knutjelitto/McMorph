[Title]     Flex

[Description]
Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical patterns in text. It
reads the given input files for a description of a scanner to generate. The description is in the
form of pairs of regular expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex(). This file is compiled and linked with the -lfl
library to produce an executable. When the executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences
of the regular expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.
