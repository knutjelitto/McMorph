[Description]
GNU Diffutils is a package containing tools for finding the differences between files. The diff
command is used to show how two files differ, while cmp shows the offsets and line numbers where
they differ. diff3 allows you to compare three files. Finally, sdiff offers an interactive means to
merge two files.
