[Title]     GNU Sed

[Description]
Sed is a non-interactive, text stream editor. It receives a text input from a file or from standard
input and it then applies a series of text editing commands to the stream and prints its output to
standard output. It is often used for substituting text patterns in a stream. The GNU
implementation offers several extensions over the standard utility.
